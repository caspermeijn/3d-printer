# Gardena Lawnmower roller

This is a larger sized roller for the Gardena Cylinder Lawnmower Classic 400. I want to mow my grass at 60mm, which is not possible with the Classic 400. This larger roller will increase the height of the mower.

You have to print 1 middle part and 2 end-caps. The parts screw into each other.
