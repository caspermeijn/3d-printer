# Test-tube holder v2

Design for a test-tube holder. Our test tubes were the packaging of some herbs. Now they are in a holder with plant cuttings inside.

Based on the work of Ivo Meier: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2773490
I fixed the front cut when diameter of glas is < 25 mm.

Open is customizer to adjust it to your needs - have fun!
